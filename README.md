I developed a Hospital Management System using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to manage patient and hospital-related information efficiently.
The system includes features like patient registration, appointment booking, doctor details, and billing management. 
It provides a user-friendly interface for easy data entry and retrieval.
This project helped me improve my frontend development skills and understand real-time workflow management. 
It also demonstrates how web technologies can be used to simplify hospital operations.
